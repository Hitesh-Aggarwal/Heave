          <p>With the rise of the personal computer and game consoles, developments within the entertainment
            industry show an increase in digital toys. In order to encourage physical activity among children, new
            trends emerge, combining physical movement and interaction with such toys. Examples of such platforms
            are the Nintendo WiiTM, Nintendo DSTM, and the PlayStation2TM EyeToy PlayTM. The success of these
            platforms indicates the potential of such bodily interactions in digital games. We see existing physical
            games like bowling, tennis, and other physical games digitalized, yet controlled in a similar way to the
            actual game. However, most of these games still focus on or around a screen and thereby miss
            opportunities in areas like active physical play and room for playing in large groups. In order to
            address these opportunities, we focused on the integration of digital elements into a physical game,
            instead of looking for the integration of physical interaction within a digital game.</p>

                      <em>fundamental</em>
                      technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
                      web.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                      In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all
                      about, and why you too should learn it.
                    </p>
            
                    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
                    <p>
                      HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
                      <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup
                      language that web developers use to structure and describe the content
                      of a webpage (not a programming language).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
                      paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers
                      understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
                    </p>
                    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
            
                    <ol>
                      <li>The opening tag</li>
                      <li>The closing tag</li>
                      <li>The actual element</li>
                    </ol>
            
                    <p> -->

                    <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
            
                    <p>
                      There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of
                      the web. Here are 5 of them:
                    </p>
            
                    <ul>
                      <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
                      <li>
                        To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
                        Worpress or Wix
                      </li>
                      <li>To build web applications</li>
            <li>To impress friends</li>
            <li>To have fun üòÉ</li>
          </ul>
  
          <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p> -->
