                <p>
                    Audrey Hepburn was an icon.

                    Rising to fame in the 1950s, she was one of the greatest actresses of her era. In 1953, Hepburn
                    became the first
                    actress to win an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a BAFTA Award for a single performance:
                    her leading role
                    in the romantic comedy Roman Holiday.

                    Even today, over half a century later, she remains one of just 15 people to earn an “EGOT” by
                    winning all four major
                    entertainment awards: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony. By the 1960s, she was averaging more than one
                    new film per year
                    and, by everyone's estimation, she was on a trajectory to be a movie star for decades to come.

                    But then something funny happened: she stopped acting.

                    Despite being in her 30s and at the height of her popularity, Hepburn basically stopped appearing in
                    films after
                    1967. She would perform in television shows or movies just five times during the rest of her life. <a href="#">  Read More...</a>

                <h3>What I Do When I Feel Like Giving Up</h3>
                <p>I am struggling today. If you’ve ever struggled to be consistent with something you care about, maybe
                    my struggle will resonate with you too.

                    It has been 939 days since November 12, 2012. That’s the date when I first published an article on
                    JamesClear.com and it’s almost 2 years and 7 months ago. During these 939 mostly glorious, sometimes
                    frustrating days, I have written a new post every Monday and Thursday. Week after week. Month after
                    month. Year after year.
                    But today? Well, today I am struggling. Today, I don’t feel like writing. Today, I don’t feel like
                    sticking to the routine. Today, I don’t feel like I have any great ideas and I don’t feel like I
                    have enough time to make the good ideas great. Today, I feel like giving up.

                    Research from the University of Pennsylvania has shown that grit is the characteristic linked most
                    closely to success. I could use some grit today.

                    Here’s what I try to remind myself of when I feel like giving up…<a href="#">  Read More...</a>

                <h3>The Beginner’s Guide to Deliberate Practice</h3>
                <p>In some circles, Ben Hogan is credited with “inventing practice.”

                    Hogan was one of the greatest golfers of the 20th century, an accomplishment he achieved through
                    tireless repetition. He simply loved to practice. Hogan said, “I couldn't wait to get up in the
                    morning so I could hit balls. I'd be at the practice tee at the crack of dawn, hit balls for a few
                    hours, then take a break and get right back to it.”

                    For Hogan, every practice session had a purpose. He reportedly spent years breaking down each phase
                    of the golf swing and testing new methods for each segment. The result was near perfection. He
                    developed one of the most finely-tuned golf swings in the history of the game.

                    His precision made him more like a surgeon than a golfer. During the 1953 Masters, for example,
                    Hogan hit the flagstick on back-to-back holes. A few days later, he broke the tournament scoring
                    record.<a href="#">  Read More...</a>

                <h3>How Experts Figure What to Focus On</h3>
                <p>
                    Peak performance experts say things like, “You should focus. You need to eliminate the distractions.
                    Commit to one thing and become great at that thing.”

                    This is good advice. The more I study successful people from all walks of life—artists, athletes,
                    entrepreneurs, scientists—the more I believe focus is a core factor of success.

                    But there is a problem with this advice too.

                    Of the many options in front of you, how do you know what to focus on? How do you know where to
                    direct your energy and attention? How do you determine the one thing that you should commit to
                    doing?

                    I don’t claim to have all the answers, but let me share what I’ve learned so far.<a href="#">  Read More...</a>

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Everyone struggles to create great art. Even great artists.

                    Anyone who creates something on a consistent basis will begin to judge their own work. I write new
                    articles every Monday and Thursday. After sticking to that publishing schedule for three months, I
                    began to judge everything I created. I was convinced that I had gone through every decent idea I had
                    available. My most popular article came 8 months later.

                    It is natural to judge your work. It is natural to feel disappointed that your creation isn't as
                    wonderful as you hoped it would be, or that you're not getting any better at your craft. But the key
                    is to not let your discontent prevent you from continuing to do the work.

                    You have to practice enough self-compassion to not let self-judgement take over. Sure, you care
                    about your work, but don't get so serious about it that you can't laugh off your mistakes and
                    continue to produce the thing you love. Don't let judgment prevent delivery.<a href="#">  Read More...</a>

                <h3>The Ultimate Habit Tracker Guide: Why and How to Track Your Habits</h3>
                <p>
                    If you want to stick with a habit for good, one simple and effective thing you can do is keep a
                    habit tracker.

                    Here's why:

                    Elite performers will often measure, quantify, and track their progress in various ways. Each little
                    measurement provides feedback. It offers a signal of whether they are making progress or need to
                    change course.

                    Gabrielle Hamilton, a chef in New York City, provides a good example. During an interview with the
                    New York Times, she said, “The one thing I see that consistently separates the chef from the home
                    cook is that we taste everything, all the time, before we commit it to the dish, right down to the
                    grains of salt. We slurp shot glasses of olive oil and aerate them in our mouths as if it were a
                    wine we were trying to know. We taste the lamb, the fish, the butter, the milk before we use it… we
                    chew salt to see how we like it in our teeth, on our tongues, and to know its flavor, its salinity.”

                    For the chef, tasting the ingredients tells them whether they are making progress toward their
                    desired end goal. It provides the immediate feedback they need to get the recipe just right.<a href="#">  Read More...</a>

                <p>
                    The ultimate productivity hack is saying no.

                    Not doing something will always be faster than doing it. This statement reminds me of the old
                    computer programming saying, “Remember that there is no code faster than no code.”

                    The same philosophy applies in other areas of life. For example, there is no meeting that goes
                    faster than not having a meeting at all.

                    This is not to say you should never attend another meeting, but the truth is that we say yes to many
                    things we don't actually want to do. There are many meetings held that don't need to be held. There
                    is a lot of code written that could be deleted.

                    How often do people ask you to do something and you just reply, “Sure thing.” Three days later,
                    you're overwhelmed by how much is on your to-do list. We become frustrated by our obligations even
                    though we were the ones who said yes to them in the first place.

                    It's worth asking if things are necessary. Many of them are not, and a simple “no” will be more
                    productive than whatever work the most efficient person can muster.

                    But if the benefits of saying no are so obvious, then why do we say yes so often?<a href="#">  Read More...</a>

                <h3>7 Ways to Retain More of Every Book You Read</h3>
                <p>
                    There are many benefits to reading more books, but perhaps my favorite is this: A good book can give
                    you a new way to interpret your past experiences.

                    Whenever you learn a new mental model or idea, it's like the “software” in your brain gets updated.
                    Suddenly, you can run all of your old data points through a new program. You can learn new lessons
                    from old moments. As Patrick O'Shaughnessy says, “Reading changes the past.”

                    Of course, this is only true if you internalize and remember insights from the books you read.
                    Knowledge will only compound if it is retained. In other words, what matters is not simply reading
                    more books, but getting more out of each book you read.

                    Gaining knowledge is not the only reason to read, of course. Reading for pleasure or entertainment
                    can be a wonderful use of time, but this article is about reading to learn. With that in mind, I'd
                    like to share some of the best reading comprehension strategies I’ve found.<a href="#">  Read More...</a>

                    Some experts believe the feathers of birds evolved from reptilian scales. Through the forces of
                    evolution, scales gradually became small feathers, which were used for warmth and insulation at
                    first. Eventually, these small fluffs developed into larger feathers capable of flight.

                    There wasn't a magical moment when the animal kingdom said, “Let's start from scratch and create an
                    animal that can fly.” The development of flying birds was a gradual process of iterating and
                    expanding upon ideas that already worked.

                    The process of human flight followed a similar path. We typically credit Orville and Wilbur Wright
                    as the inventors of modern flight. However, we seldom discuss the aviation pioneers who preceded
                    them like Otto Lilienthal, Samuel Langley, and Octave Chanute. The Wright brothers learned from and
                    built upon the work of these people during their quest to create the world's first flying machine.

                    The most creative innovations are often new combinations of old ideas. Innovative thinkers don't
                    create, they connect. Furthermore, the most effective way to make progress is usually by making 1
                    percent improvements to what already works rather than breaking down the whole system and starting
                    over.<a href="#">  Read More...</a>

                <p>
                    In 1955, Disneyland had just opened in Anaheim, California, when a ten-year-old boy walked in and
                    asked for a job. Labor laws were loose back then and the boy managed to land a position selling
                    guidebooks for $0.50 apiece.

                    Within a year, he had transitioned to Disney’s magic shop, where he learned tricks from the older
                    employees. He experimented with jokes and tried out simple routines on visitors. Soon he discovered
                    that what he loved was not performing magic but performing in general. He set his sights on becoming
                    a comedian.

                    Beginning in his teenage years, he started performing in little clubs around Los Angeles. The crowds
                    were small and his act was short. He was rarely on stage for more than five minutes. Most of the
                    people in the crowd were too busy drinking or talking with friends to pay attention. One night, he
                    literally delivered his stand-up routine to an empty club.

                    It wasn’t glamorous work, but there was no doubt he was getting better. His first routines would
                    only last one or two minutes. By high school, his material had expanded to include a five-minute act
                    and, a few years later, a ten-minute show<a href="#">  Read More...</a>
