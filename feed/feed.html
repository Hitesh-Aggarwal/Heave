            <p>Audrey Hepburn was an icon.
            
                Rising to fame in the 1950s, she was one of the greatest actresses of her era. In 1953, Hepburn became the first
                actress to win an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a BAFTA Award for a single performance: her leading role
                in the romantic comedy Roman Holiday.
            
                Even today, over half a century later, she remains one of just 15 people to earn an “EGOT” by winning all four major
                entertainment awards: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony. By the 1960s, she was averaging more than one new film per year
                and, by everyone's estimation, she was on a trajectory to be a movie star for decades to come.
            
                But then something funny happened: she stopped acting.
            
                Despite being in her 30s and at the height of her popularity, Hepburn basically stopped appearing in films after
                1967. She would perform in television shows or movies just five times during the rest of her life.
