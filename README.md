Ideation:  With the advent of cyberbullying and its prevalence among the young adult community, the victims need to come together in solidarity to share their experiences, empower and uplift themselves from the vicious cycle they find themselves in. We, The Team- The Hex Clan- aim to create an ambitious project, with the idea of creating a community of victims of bullying and other malicious practices at its centre.


A.	Our project will consist of a website- a social media platform. While they surf their feed consisting of articles and blog posts where users can share their stories and other helpful information to support those who are suffering as they did- and are- while also retaining their anonymity.



B.	The user can also browse through various music libraries to relax themselves while also sharing songs they find helpful and therapeutic.



C.	The website will also cycle through special events and guest seminars that the users can attend to gain inspiration. We attempt to provide the user with the opportunity to take a proactive stance for a better future.



D.	Last, but not the least, we plan to design a goal manager to encourage users to take the step to improve their lives.
